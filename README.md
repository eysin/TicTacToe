This is the Late-Term assignment for the HUGB classes in the University of Reykjavik.


We're going to be using React-js as the skeleton behind the project, and will creating a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe

Since we're not storing the node-js packages locally, once we have fetched the git repostiory, the script 

"npm install" needs to be run in the console in order for all the packages defined in the packages.json file to be loaded.




Members of our group are:
  Eyþór Örn Hafliðason
  Sofia Basilio
  Rolandas Mineika
  Axel Valur Þórisson
  Jakob Örn Guðnason
